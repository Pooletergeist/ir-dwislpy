# HW. 5 submission. JMP - Dec 12
#

Hi Jim,
This Zip has my current work on HW5. I'm still working on it â€” trying to get
the new starter code to play nice with my HW4 submission. In the meatnime, I've
written translation code for all the exercise but have yet to test it. 
I'm feeling shaky on my return code for Func calls (step 6) but feeling
pretty confident in the earlier exercises.

CHANGELOG:
 - implemented TMES, MNUS
 - implemented Equl, LsEq
 - added trans to all ast-nodes in .hh, added trans\_cdn to potential boolean 
    conditionals, conj/disj, not, func
 - added conditional translations
 - added logical translations
 - brought dwislpyc into makefile
 - changed dwislpy-main.hh to set program = prgm instead of main = prgm
 - started using dwislpy-main.hh from the HW5 starter code. 

worrying:
 - any include statements needed? Added inst.hh to ast.hh
